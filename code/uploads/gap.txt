Unfortunately, without the specific details of the job description under 'Areas B,' it is not possible to carry out an exact matching of skills or identify gaps relative to the job requirements. Generally, Valeriia's resume suggests a strong candidate with a broad technical skillset and relevant internship experiences. Once the job posting is available, assessments regarding skill matches, experience coverage, and suggestions for additional courses or certifications can be provided more precisely.

In the absence of the job posting, it is advisable for Valeriia to:
- Review typical job descriptions in her field of interest to identify commonly required skills and experiences she may lack.
- Seek out additional hands-on projects, internships, or part-time roles to further develop areas of perceived weakness.
- Consider certifications or online courses in emerging technologies or methodologies that are gaining traction within her industry.
- Tailor her resume to highlight projects and courses that align closely with the roles she is applying for, using keywords and phrases from the job descriptions.
- Continue to participate in professional organizations and networking events in her field to expand her connections and stay abreast of industry developments. 

Specific courses or certifications that might enhance her profile could include:
- Advanced certifications in programming languages relevant to the job.
- Training in Agile or Scrum methodologies, if she is interested in roles with a software development focus.
- A professional certification in system security or networking, if the job has a cybersecurity or IT component.
- An industry-recognized certification in systems engineering or project management if she aims to move into a leadership role.
